# HLI Streaming (Send/Receive) Interfaces

This section describes the use of the HLI type system to provide an API
abstraction for streaming hardware modules. We will describe memory
mapped interfaces later. We continue to use C-style pseudocode here,
though it may or may not be appropriate for the target language.

## Type declarations

HLI types may be declared and named at the global and local scope.

## Ports

**Keywords:** input, output

Verilog-style ports are extended to support an HLI data-type as the port
type. Port directions (input, output) are required and work as expected.
Any type, named or anonymous, may be used as a port declaration.

The default semantics are that the data-type in an interface is
presented atomically (single-cycle) to or from the module, except for
lists. Fine-grained control of presentation scheduling for large
data-types is described below in the [data windows](#Data_Windows)
section.

Parameter types used in port declarations must have parameters fully
specified. Module parameters may be used to fully specify them.
Multiplexing a port (using it for multiple messages) can be achieved by
using a discriminated union as the port type.

### Ports Example

```c++
union RamRWReq<uint64 aWidth> {
    uint<aWidth> as ReadAddr;
    struct {
        uint<aWidth> addr;
        uint<64> data;
    } Write;
};

//Dual ported, 64-bit wide RAM with second port being read only
module RAM <uint64 depth> {
    LOCALPARAM aWidth = $clog2(depth);
    input RamRWReq<aWidth> portA;
    input uint<aWidth> portB; // Just accepts an address
    output uint64 dataOutA; // Output data if read
    output uint64 dataOutB; // Output data if read
}
```

## Data Windows

**Keyword**: window

By default, an entire message is guaranteed to be presented to the
receiving module in one clock cycle (excepting lists). For particularly
large messages, this is not ideal as it requires a data path equal to
the size of the message. Data windows specify which parts of a message a
module can accept on each clock cycle for immediate consumption. For
structs, they specify which members are accepted on which cycles. For
arrays and lists, they specify how many items (potentially fractional)
can be accepted each clock cycle.

It is important to note that data windows do not affect port
compatibility. In other words, a designer can connect ports using two
different windows into the same data type. This can be used to connect
different modules with different bandwidths. A data window merely
specifies the logical "gasket" used to connect two differently sized
ports.

Reordering of struct members (except lists and between list boundaries)
is allowed but may have performance/area side-effects. For example,
re-ordering large arrays creates the need for large amounts of memory
and is likely to introduce bubbles and -- later -- backpressure.

For example, while the Compressor example below may appear to have a
bandwidth of 1 byte/cycle, this need not be the case. That same message
data type can be used by compression blocks with any bandwidth. The
compiler just has to be smart enough to know that the module can accept
up to N packets per cycle, then design a wire-level interface to suite.
When components have different bandwidths, the compiler can design the
proper hardware to narrow or widen the data path.

### Data Window Examples

```c++
// A module that reads up to 10 bytes / cycle and writes up to
// 7 bytes / cycle
typedef list uint8 DataList;
window(DataList) TenPerCycle { 10 }
module Compressor {
    input TenPerCycle dataIn;
    output window(DataList) { 7 } dataOut;
}
```

```c++
// An example of breaking up a large struct with data windows
struct DataRecord {
    uint64 ID;
    uint512 CryptoHash;
    uint8[16] DisplayName;
    uint16 a, b, c, d, e;
    list uint8 Blob;
}

window (DataRecord) DataRecordParts {
    Part1 {
        ID, DisplayName // Accept ID and DisplayName
                        // on the first cycle
    }
    Part2 { CryptoHash } // Accept the CryptoHash on the second
    Part3 {a .. e} // Accept a, b, c, d, and e
    PartRemainder {
        Blob { 64 } // Accept 64 bytes / cycle
    }
}

module RecordProcessor {
    input DataRecordParts in;
}

// This module can be connected to 'RecordProcessor', which accepts the staticly
// sized part of the struct in one cycle and this list one uint8 (byte) at a time
module RecordCreator {
    output DataRecord out;
}
```

## Data Blinds

By default, all the data in a message must be sent/received. Data blinds
are a feature of data windows which allows modules to specify that they
either don't want to receive or do not send a particular field. If a
data blind is specified on an output, there are two options depending on
the level of safety required: (1) fill in that field with the default
value or (2) disallow any input interface which does not have a data
window also includes that blind.

### Data Blind Example

```c++
// Builds on previous example
window (DataRecord) DataRecordBlinds {
    -CryptoHash, // Don't send/recv CrypoHash
    -a..c // or a, b, or c
}
```
